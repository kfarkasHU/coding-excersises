Here is a simple programming challenge. Could you have a go at solving it? Example question 1 (shorter time frame): Write a function to compute the Nth Fibonacci number. Example question 2 (longer time frame): Write a function that takes the current position of a knight on a chessboard, and returns a preliminary list of possible moves the knight could make. (That is, the current positions of other pieces are not provided, so you can’t check against capturing pieces on the knight’s own side nor making their king vulnerable to capture.)
